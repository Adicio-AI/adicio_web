Sentiment Analysis: We tried it on US stocks. We found stocks with no correlation, stocks with weak correlation, and some stocks that correlated wtih sentiment. (We used Twitter as the source of sentiment mischief.) There were three take-aways:
- Sentiment to price movement correlation varied over time.
- Rigorous statistical technique is required to separate signal from noise.
- There is a correlation between the stock price and *then* sentiment. In other words, if the stock price went up, sentiment turned positive. If the stock price went down, sentiment turned negative.
