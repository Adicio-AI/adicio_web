Sentiment Analysis: We ran sentiment analysis on US stock prices. We used Twitter for sentiment. Here's what we found:
* Stock prices with no correlation to sentiment
* Stock prices with a weak correlation to sentiment
* Stock prices with some correlation with sentiment.

There were three take-aways:
- The correlation of price to sentiment varied over time.
- Rigorous statistical technique is required to separate signal from noise.
- There is a correlation between the stock price and *then* sentiment. In other words, if the stock price went up, sentiment turned positive. If the stock price went down, sentiment turned negative.
